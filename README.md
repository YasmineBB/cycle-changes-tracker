## Introduction  

Cycle Changes Tracker is an application developed to help women track changes to their cycle upon changing their method of birth control. 

## User Experience  

### Target Audience  

The target audience for this app are:

- Women who have changed their method of birth control as a means of finding the best option for them in terms of pain management.
