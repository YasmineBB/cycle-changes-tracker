## Introduction  

Cycle Changes Tracker is a Command Line Interface application developed to help women track changes to their cycle upon changing their method of birth control.  

This application has been developed with Python.

## User Experience  

### Target Audience  

The target audience for this app are:

- Women who have changed their method of birth control as a means of finding the best option for them in terms of pain management.
  
- Women who are starting birth control and want to keep track of their symptoms to see if the method is suited to them or whether they need to look at other options.  

Once the change has been made, it is important to monitor and track changes in their symptoms during their cycle following the change in order to feedback to their GP or Gynaecologist, analyse the data and figure out the next point of action.

## User Stories  

Below are some scenarios a user may find themselves in which would using the Cycle Changes Tracker may prove helpful.  

- *I am changing from a Copper IUD to a Hormonal IUD due to experiencing severe pain during my menstrual cycle and want to track any changes in my symptoms to feedback to my Gynaecologist.*  
  
- *I am experimenting stopping my birth control for a period of time as suggested by my Gynaecologist. She has advised me to monitor any changes to my menstrual flow and pain experienced to feed back to her after 3 months.*  
  
- *I am starting birth control and want to keep track of my symptoms so, if required to change in the future, I can find the method that works best for me.*

### Future Features to Implement  

There are many features that would really boost the overall functionality of this app and make it more in depth in assisting with the users concerns. I have listed several which I would, and plan to, implement with more time.

#### Mood Tracker  

Alongside tracking pain and flow level, another feature to implement would be a mood tracker to track the users mood symptoms.

## Technologies Used

  - To add some visuals to the questions asking the user to choose their pain and flow level on a scale, I initially used four colours
